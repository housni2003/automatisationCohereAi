# Selenium Setup Guide

This guide will help you install the necessary packages and set up your environment for using Selenium with Python.

## Installation

1. **Install Selenium:**

    ```sh
    pip install selenium
    ```

2. **Install WebDriver**

    Depending on your browser, you will need to install the appropriate WebDriver. For example, for Google Chrome:

    - **Download ChromeDriver** from the [official site](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/).
    - Extract the executable and place it in a directory included in your system's PATH, or specify the path directly in your script.

email_field.send_keys("") ## your mail line 18 here you put your mail
mdp_field.send_keys("") #your password line 27 here you put your password

text_field.send_keys("hello") #text you want to submit to cohere line 54, here the text you want to submit to cohere ai.

this program is useful if you have a tool that continuously search for data and you need to put them in a LLM, with this program you don't have to put them manually in the LLM. you just need to connect your program and mine, and put the data line 54.
